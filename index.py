#Exercises
#Exercise #1
#Write a function that takes a list of integers and returns the median value. *Can assume that the list of integers is sorted in ascending value*.

def solution(data1):
    nums = [2, 3, 5, 8, 9, 17]
    nums.sort()
    data1 = len(nums)
    if data1 % 2 == 1
    middle = len(data1 += data1 // 2)

    return middle 


#Exercise #2
#Create a function that counts how many distinct words are in the string below, then outputs a dictionary with the words as the key and the value as the amount of times that word appears in the string.

#Example Output:{'in': 1, 'computing': 1, 'a': 5, ...}

a_text = 'In computing, a hash table hash map is a data structure in computing which implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values. A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots from which the desired value can be found'
 
def soulution(string1):
    for x in string1 
    string1.count(a_text{0,-1})
    if string1.count(x)=> 0
    return string1.count(x) + string1.count 

#Exercise #3
#Write a function implementing a Linear Search Algorithm. A linear search is a method for finding an element within a list. It sequentially checks each element of the list until a match is found or the whole list has been searched. If you do not find a match, return -1. You can assume the list is sorted

def soulution(list1):
    list7 = [2,4,5,6,8]
    new = list1.search(list7(6))
    print (solution(new))
